# DistanceAlarm

**Real-time motion detection and proximity monitoring system built with Rust for Raspberry Pi Pico W using ultrasonic sensor technology.**

## Description

DistanceAlarm is an embedded security and monitoring application that leverages my custom UltraMeasure library to provide intelligent motion detection and object proximity sensing. The system continuously monitors a defined area and triggers alerts when movement is detected or objects enter the monitored zone, making it ideal for security applications, automation systems, and proximity-based controls.

Built with async Rust and the Embassy framework, the system delivers reliable, non-blocking performance perfect for real-time monitoring scenarios.
